# GraphTheoremDestroyer
## Description
GraphTheoremDestroyer is a complex and powerful system able to prove or reject any fact from the theory of graphs in just a few seconds. It is powered by a magnificent piece of code written in C - known as the best language humanity ever created.
## Methodology
We use SCRUM with 3 week sprints and biweekly meetings (twice a week). 
## Workflow
We use github-flow. Stable and tested in respect to functionality, correctness and cleanness code is on the main branch. All new features are developed on separate branches called *developer_name*-*feature_name*. Branch main is protected from pushing before all the tests are run successfully and all project collabolators approve the changes.
## Theorems we want to prove for special cases
* Erdos-Gyarfas conjecture
* Every graph with chromatic number greater than 3 contains K4 as a minor
* Every 4-connected graph has a K5 or K3,3 as a minor
* If graph is C5-free, then the chromatic number is at most 3
* Every bridgeless graph has a hamiltonian path
